## Instructions for Burning DVDs

The scripts are setup on the DVD burning laptop. 

1. Insert the SD card into the card reader. You should see the card show up on the desktop. It should read `CANON`.

2. Once the SD card is in, open the Terminal application and type `early`.

You should see the files copying over and then the DVD creation process begin. This will take 30-40 minutes to complete. Once the process has completed, you will see a command prompt with a blinking cursor.

You should now see two folders on the desktop labeled with the date.

`YYYY-MM-DD_early` and `YYYY-MM-DD_DVD`

3. The next step is to burn the DVDs. Place a blank DVD in the DVD drive and wait a few seconds for it to load. Then, open the terminal application and type `burn`.

You should see the progress of the DVD burning on the command line. When it completes, it will eject.

Place another DVD in the burner and type `burn` again in the command prompt.
